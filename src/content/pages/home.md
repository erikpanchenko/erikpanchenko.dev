Hi, I'm Erik, a Senior Implementation Engineer focused on CDP architecture, data strategy and consent-aware measurement.

I help organisations design, implement and fix Customer Data Platforms, with a strong focus on Tealium-based ecosystems, consent orchestration and long-term data governance.

I work hands-on with teams to ensure their data foundations are reliable, compliant, and actually usable — not just technically “working”.

## What I help with

- **CDP Strategy & Implementation**  
  Architecture, identity strategy, activation, and integrations

- **Consent & Privacy Orchestration**  
  CMP integration, consent-aware tracking, and regional compliance patterns

- **Data layer & Tracking Design**  
  Scalable event and attribute models teams can actually govern

- **Tealium CDP Clean-ups & Remediation**  
  Auditing, simplifying, and reducing event volume in mature Tealium accounts

## Tealium CDP Clean-ups & Remediation

A large part of my work — and something I genuinely enjoy — is **cleaning up existing CDP implementations** that have grown over time.

Many Tealium accounts reach a point where:
- Hundreds of attributes exist with unclear ownership  
- Naming standards were never enforced  
- Multiple teams and agencies have come and gone  
- No one is confident deleting anything, even when it’s unused  
- Event volume has steadily grown without active governance  
- Performance, governance, usability — and costs — start to suffer  

This is a common and very real pain point for long-running enterprise accounts.

I specialise in **systematic CDP clean-ups**, where the goal is not just to “delete things”, but to:
- Audit the current state and identify what is actually in use  
- Reduce unnecessary attributes, events, and logic safely  
- Rationalise incoming event volume by removing redundant, low-value, or legacy tracking  
- Align event collection with real analytics, personalisation, and activation needs  
- Re-establish naming conventions and ownership models  
- Improve performance, maintainability, and team confidence  
- Leave behind clear documentation and a future-proof structure  

Reducing incoming event volume is often one of the highest-impact outcomes of this work.  
Since Tealium licensing is directly tied to event volume, this commonly leads to **lower ongoing platform costs**, including future annual licence fees — not just technical improvements.

I can support this in two ways:
- **Audit and guidance** — detailed analysis with clear recommendations and implementation instructions for your team  
- **Hands-on delivery** — I come in and do the clean-up myself, working directly in the platform  

I have a strong track record helping teams untangle complex Tealium setups and turn them back into systems people actually trust, understand, and can afford to scale.

## How I typically work

- Short-term or fixed-scope engagements (e.g. audits, clean-ups, transformations)  
- Embedded support within existing teams  
- Architecture-first, implementation-aware approach  
- Clear documentation and knowledge transfer as part of the outcome

If you’re running a Tealium or CDP implementation that feels **bloated, fragile, or hard to reason about**, I can help you get it back under control — and set it up so it stays that way.

Hi, I'm Erik, a MarTech / CDP engineer focused on Tealium architecture, data strategy, and
consent-aware measurement.

I help organisations design, implement, and fix Customer Data Platforms — with a strong focus on **Tealium-based ecosystems**, consent orchestration and long-term data governance.

My work typically sits at the intersection of **CDP architecture, privacy, analytics, and marketing activation**. I work hands-on with teams to ensure their data foundations are reliable, compliant, and actually usable — not just technically “working”.

## What I help with

**CDP strategy and implementation**  
End-to-end design and delivery of CDP solutions, from data modelling and identity strategy through to activation and downstream integrations. This includes greenfield implementations as well as incremental evolution of mature stacks.

**Consent orchestration and privacy architecture**  
Designing and implementing consent frameworks that work across regions, devices, and platforms. This includes CMP integration, consent-aware data collection, and ensuring marketing and analytics tooling behaves correctly under different consent states.

**Data layer and tracking architecture**  
Defining clear, scalable event and attribute models that support analytics, personalisation, and marketing use cases without creating unnecessary complexity or technical debt.

## Special focus: cleaning up mature and messy implementations

A large part of my work — and something I genuinely enjoy — is **cleaning up existing CDP implementations** that have grown over time.

Many Tealium accounts reach a point where:
- Hundreds of attributes exist with unclear ownership  
- Naming standards were never enforced  
- Multiple teams and agencies have come and gone  
- No one is confident deleting anything, even when it’s unused  
- Event volume has steadily grown without active governance  
- Performance, governance, usability — and costs — start to suffer  

This is a common and very real pain point for long-running enterprise accounts.

I specialise in **systematic CDP clean-ups**, where the goal is not just to “delete things”, but to:
- Audit the current state and identify what is actually in use  
- Reduce unnecessary attributes, events, and logic safely  
- Rationalise incoming event volume by removing redundant, low-value, or legacy tracking  
- Align event collection with real analytics, personalisation, and activation needs  
- Re-establish naming conventions and ownership models  
- Improve performance, maintainability, and team confidence  
- Leave behind clear documentation and a future-proof structure  

Reducing incoming event volume is often one of the highest-impact outcomes of this work.  
Since Tealium licensing is directly tied to event volume, this commonly leads to **lower ongoing platform costs**, including future annual licence fees — not just technical improvements.

I can support this in two ways:
- **Audit and guidance** — detailed analysis with clear recommendations and implementation instructions for your team  
- **Hands-on delivery** — I come in and do the clean-up myself, working directly in the platform  

I have a strong track record helping teams untangle complex Tealium setups and turn them back into systems people actually trust, understand, and can afford to scale.

## How I typically work

- Short-term or fixed-scope engagements (e.g. audits, clean-ups, transformations)  
- Embedded support within existing teams  
- Architecture-first, implementation-aware approach  
- Clear documentation and knowledge transfer as part of the outcome

If you’re running a Tealium or CDP implementation that feels **bloated, fragile, or hard to reason about**, I can help you get it back under control — and set it up so it stays that way.
